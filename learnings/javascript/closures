Remember :
    In javascript , a function can return another function itself from the return statement.
    The function returned , will retain its body, including varaible defined, conditions etc.
    Also the function being returned will act as child of the function from where it is getting returned.
    Thus, it will also have access to parents variables, through js lexical scoping.
    Lexical Scoping : It is nothing but looking above the current scope for more info required from current functional scope.
    Thus when the function being return can access the variables of it parents even if parent function is not in JS stack, after being called is termed as closure.



Benefit of Closure :
  See in the Javascript , we dont have public , private variable defenition like java .
  So when required that we create a private function, any logical statement not defined publically and varaibles,
  we can create with closures.

Example :
     

    const myMainPublicContainer=(
        function(){
            //body of anonymous functions.
            let privateVariable =0;
            function changeValue(value){
                return privateVariable +=value;
            }
            return{
                increment:function(){
                    return changeValue(1);
                },
                decrement:function(){
                    return changeValue(-1);
                },
                value:function(){
                    return privateVariable
                }
            }
        }
    )()

    console.log(myMainPublicContainer);
    console.log(myMainPublicContainer.increment());
    


In the above example, we have used IFFE (immediatly invoked functional expression), to call the function and store its value in the given above myMainPublicContainer variable.
This will enable us , to call functions defined in return statement, like increment, decrement , without actually giving access to variable and the core function of changevraible to public.

Remember :
   In Closure , the design should look like : 
        function{
                //some logic
                //variables

            return anotherFun{
                //some logic
                //can access parent varaible(NOTE :always looks for the update state of the parent varaible.)
            }
        }
