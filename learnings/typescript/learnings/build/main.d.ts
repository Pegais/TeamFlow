 * TypeScript is a strongly type language
 * A superSet of Javascript
 * A strongly typed language can either be statically or dynamically typed.
 * NOTE : TYPESCRIPT IS A STATICALLY TYPES LANGUAGE.
 * WHY : BECAUSE TYPES ARE CHECKED AT COMPILE TIME.
 * JAVASCRIPT IS A DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE AND IT MEANS THAT THE TYPES
 * ARE CHECKED AT RUN TIME.
 *
 *
 * Benefits of Typescript:
 *  Self -documenting, catching errors, and great for teams
